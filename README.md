# CS340-Project
## Client/Server Project using MongoDB and Python

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- CRUD functionality bridges the gap between accessing the database using MongoDB and utilizing Python to manipulate it. The same outcould be achieved without the functions, but the code would be very repetetive and confusing. This way of working also makes the program easily adapatable. While the program is designed to be used with the provided AAC database, it can be updated to be used with any database with minimal changes needed for the code to work properly. Without these functions we would need to change every spot where the function would be called within the program instead of changing the CRUD functions to apply it to all calls.
  
### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

- With this being my first time working with MongoDB and databases, it took a lot of trial and error to understand how it worked. Translating console commands into code was a lot easier since i've used python before and I had gained an understanding of how MongoDB works. The requirements for the project made the simple database into a more powerful interactive tool and having a good grasp on all the concepts involved helps to create code that works as intended.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

- Computer science is about more than just coding; Planning, analyzing, and testing are also important skill sets involved in the task. I mentioned above that a program like this can tranform a database into a powerful tool for a company like Salvare's, allowing them to quickly and easily analyze data to find what they need. A computer scientists job is to make sure the program works as intended and ensure the code is error free through planning and testing.
